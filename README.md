# Hello World module for Apache 2.2

## Introduction

This module code is taken from the
[companion site](http://www.apachetutor.org/book/) to the
[The Apache Modules Book](http://www.apachetutor.org/#book) and
corresponds to the example on Chapter 5. 

## Comparison with Nginx module

Although the output differs from the
[Nginx hello world module](https://github.com/perusio/nginx-hello-world-module)
a comparison between both modules is appropriate. The Nginx module is
more complex, but gives you higher performance and a finer control of
the way the module operates.
